# PhoneBook
A simple project to demonstrate the functionality of basic search algorithms.

For the provided files **directory.txt** (the "Phonebook") and **find txt** (contains a list of names to find)
were implemented basic search and sorting algorithms such as:

- **linear search**
- **bubble sort + jump_search** (At this point this stage is commented out as it works too slow because of 
the specifics of the search algorithm)
- **quicksort + binary search**
- **hashtable**

The results of the last search using hashtable are written into a file **foundNumbers.txt**
